<p>깃블로그 사용 이유</p>

<p>1. 내가 원하는 대로 수정가능!</p>

<p>깃블로그로 구성하면 내가 원하는대로 블로그의 양식(테마) 등을 설정할 수 있다.</p>

<p>2. Github와의 연동성</p>

<p>코드를 저장하고 관리하기 쉬운 github 사이트, 깃블로그 운영으로 인해 포트폴리오와 작업과정들을 보다 쉽게 관리할 수 있다.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
